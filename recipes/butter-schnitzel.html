    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>Butter schnitzel is a delicious dish originating from Austria, where a tenderized cutlet of meat, usually veal or chicken, is breaded and fried until golden brown. The schnitzel is then topped with a rich and creamy butter sauce infused with lemon juice and parsley, adding a tangy and savory flavor. The butter sauce enhances the crispiness of the schnitzel, creating a delightful contrast of textures. This dish is often served with sides like potato salad or spaetzle, making it a hearty and satisfying meal.</p>

        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in wine and sliced mushrooms.
