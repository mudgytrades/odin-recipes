    <h2>Description</h2><p>No Bake Cookies are a type of cookie that requires no oven time. They are typically made by combining ingredients such as oats, cocoa powder, butter or margarine, sugar, milk, and sometimes peanut butter. </p>
    <p>The mixture is brought to a boil on the stove, then dropped by spoonfuls onto waxed paper or parchment to cool and set. The cookies are known for their quick preparation and chewy texture, making them a popular choice for homemade treats.</p>
